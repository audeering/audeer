class StrictVersion(Version):
    """Version numbering for anal retentives and software idealists.

    This implementation was originally part of :mod:`distutils`
    as ``version.StrictVersion``.

    A version number consists of two
    or three dot-separated numeric components,
    with an optional "pre-release" tag on the end.
    The pre-release tag consists of the letter 'a' or 'b'
    followed by a number.
    If the numeric components of two version numbers are equal,
    then one with a pre-release tag
    will always be deemed earlier (lesser)
    than one without.

    The following are valid version numbers
    (shown in the order
    that would be obtained
    by sorting according to the supplied cmp function):
    ``'0.4'``,
    ``'0.4.1'``,
    ``'0.5a1'``,
    ``'0.5b3'``,
    ``'0.5'``,
    ``'0.9.6'``,
    ``'1.0'``,
    ``'1.0.4a3'``,
    ``'1.0.4b1'``,
    ``'1.0.4'``.

    The following are examples of invalid version numbers:
    ``'1'``,

# The rules according to Greg Stein:
# 1) a version number has 1 or more numbers separated by a period or by
#    sequences of letters. If only periods, then these are compared
#    left-to-right to determine an ordering.
# 2) sequences of letters are part of the tuple for comparison and are
#    compared lexicographically
# 3) recognize the numeric components may have leading zeroes
#
# The LooseVersion class below implements these rules: a version number
# string is split up into a tuple of integer and string components, and
# comparison is a simple tuple comparison.  This means that version
# numbers behave in a predictable and obvious way, but a way that might
# not necessarily be how people *want* version numbers to behave.  There
# wouldn't be a problem if people could stick to purely numeric version
# numbers: just split on period and compare the numbers as tuples.
# However, people insist on putting letters into their version numbers;
# the most common purpose seems to be:
#   - indicating a "pre-release" version
#     ('alpha', 'beta', 'a', 'b', 'pre', 'p')
#   - indicating a post-release patch ('p', 'pl', 'patch')
# but of course this can't cover all version number schemes, and there's
# no way to know what a programmer means without asking him.
#
# The problem is what to do with letters (and other non-numeric
# characters) in a version number.  The current implementation does the
# obvious and predictable thing: keep them as strings and compare
# lexically within a tuple comparison.  This has the desired effect if
# an appended letter sequence implies something "post-release":
# eg. "0.99" < "0.99pl14" < "1.0", and "5.001" < "5.001m" < "5.002".
#
# However, if letters in a version number imply a pre-release version,
# the "obvious" thing isn't correct.  Eg. you would expect that
# "1.5.1" < "1.5.2a2" < "1.5.2", but under the tuple/lexical comparison
# implemented here, this just isn't so.
